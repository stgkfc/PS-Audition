This lab is submitted for consideration as my security audition for PluralSight using the guidelines and scenario provided. The lab is simple with respect to the setup, you just need a Wireshark software application. The lab is written from the perspective of an Ubuntu 20.04 distro, but could be any platform that supports Wireshark.
# Environment
Any Ubuntu 20.04 machine, this can be a local instance as well as a cloud-based. You just need the ability to run Wireshark. The capture file is located here as well as can be downloded from the Internet.
